            <p>You Muscle Loss</p>
            <p>To prevent muscle loss. 1. Don't lie in bed for a long time: Muscles are created by resisting gravity. But when you're in bed, the longitudinal axis of your body is perpendicular to the direction that gravity is acting on, so that the muscles that resist gravity are released from the load and become similar to zero gravity.</p>
