        <P>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of content. HTML consists of a series of elements that cover or enclose different parts of content to look different or to behave in a particular way. Tag-wrapping allows you to hyperlink words or images to somewhere else, italicize words, make the font larger or smaller, and so on</p>
